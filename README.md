# code_refactor

Notes:
- I learned to consolidate recurring rules into as few blocks as possible through doing this assignment.
- I also attempted to use a more standarized method for naming the site's sections to make it easier to read.
- I also used commenting to make the page make sense to another developer if they were to access the code. 
- My motivation for doing this was to learn how to use better standards for website development in terms of organization.
